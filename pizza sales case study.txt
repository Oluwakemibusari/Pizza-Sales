Youâ€™ll be playing the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired
pizza place in New Jersey. You've been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve
operations, and just received the following note:

Welcome aboard, we're glad you're here to help!
Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been
collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to
good use. Hoping you can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find
opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.

This dataset contains 4 tables, in CSV format:

A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of
each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity,
price, and ingredients.
